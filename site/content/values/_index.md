  - heading: "Technical understanding"
    text: >
       Our work is informed by hands-on exposure to engineering,
      procurement, and construction project environments. This allows us
      to assess role requirements realistically, understand technical
      constraints, and communicate effectively with both clients and
      candidates.

       We prioritise clarity, responsiveness, and accuracy. Our approach
      focuses on understanding requirements upfront, maintaining clear

     We aim to represent roles and candidates accurately, operate with

      transactional placements.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing
      coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into
      farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is
      grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about
      coffee farming on our blog.
